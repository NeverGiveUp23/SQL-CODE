# SQL-CODE



This is my journey into learning SQL by completeing projects and honestly by making mistakes and learning from it.

My main goal is to be proficient in retrieving data and understanding the queries on how to manipulate the data outcome.

I'm using postgreSQL/PGADMIN to complete these projects. I'm setting up my work by folders on each topic (JOINS, SELECT), this allows me to go back and review quickly if need be.

Thank you for viewing and if you have any advice or knowledge to share on my work, please let me know so we can chat so I can learn.
